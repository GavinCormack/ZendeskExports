# ZendeskExports
Python Scripts I wrote to export Tickets and Articles from Zendesk account.

BackupArticles.py
Creates a folder and Exports Tickets in A HTML Format. Contains all content of articles minus the CSS Styling.


BackupTickets.py
Create a folder for each ticket and exports the ticket entries into a HTML file. 
It also exports the ticket attachments into the ticket folder.
